              <p>
                Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do; once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversation?'
              </p>
              <p>
                So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was nothing so very remarkable 
                in that; nor did Alice think it so very much 
                out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to 
                itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' 
                (when she thought it over afterwards, it 
                occurred to her that she ought to have 
                wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed 
                quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually 
                took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket 
                and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice 
                started to her feet, for it flashed across her 
                mind that she had never before seen a rabbit 
                with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to 
                take out of it, and burning with curiosity, 
                she ran across the field after it, and 
                fortunately was just in time to see it 
                pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

            In another moment down went Alice after it,

            was to get out again.
