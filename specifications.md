## Your Mission  
  
Your mission is to build a homepage for your local ice cream shop. In GitHub ensure your project name starts with "wk-01".

You may *_not_* use
- any libraries, extension, modules, or frameworks _other than_ normalize.css and font-awesome
- flexbox
- animation - to be clear I'm talking about CSS3, canvas, and their ilk; you _may use_ animated gifs, but keep them portfolio professional if you do
- tables for layout of anything other than actual tabular data (depending on your design the ice cream flavors, whether they're sugar free or not, and their calories may qualify as tabular data)

Betty, the shop owner has specifically shared the following with you:

* She expects to see the following (_design notes are in parenthesis and italics_):
  * the shop's name 
  * a brief history (_may use lorem ipsum_)
  * a logo (_use an image that is licensed as modifiable, e.g. [google image search, "Tools" --> "Usage Rights" --> "Labeled for noncommercial reuse with modification"](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=ice%20cream&tbs=imgo:1#q=ice+cream&tbs=imgo:1,itp:clipart,sur:fm&tbm=isch&*)_)
  * the store's hours and contact information
  * flavors available (_list at least 5 and no more than 42_) with:
     * [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ice_cream_flavors), calorie count, and whether it is sugar free or not
     * a link for that flavor (e.g. [corresponding wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_chocolate_chip) 


As always make regular commits and use proper semantic HTML tags. 

When done, submit both the GitHub Repo Url (github.com/[username]/[repo]) and the final GitHub Pages url ([username].github.io/[repo]).

## Skilled Sorcerers and Wise Wizards  

  
Your spouse is actually the person who introduced you to Betty.  Apparently in a conversation between them Betty also mentioned that she'd really like to see every other flavor on the menu alternate its background color (commonly called "zebra striping") for easier reading, but she never mentioned it to you when you were going over requirements.  You want to make her day and give her ice cream flavors a bit of zebra flavoring. 

* Highlight rows of the table when a user hovers over them
* If a user clicks the row, make the row stay highlighted even after they stop hovering over the row

## Wise Wizards  

  
In casual conversation Betty mentioned to you that when she was checking out your LinkedIn she stumble upon this [Iron Yard](https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/4dd8da28-blog.png) page and she _really loves the layout_.  


In particular, she loves the:
 * big image across the top - "Wouldn't a banana split look better than a cityscape?"
 * circular logo that only half crosses the cityscape
 * summary information to the left
 * detailed information to the right
 * legible width of the two columns
 * spacing and font size 
 * social link in the lower-right (_she didn't give you a twitter or facebook account, so you can just mock it out for demo purposes_)
 

She would really love it if her shop's page has the same layout. So put a bow on it and make her fall in love with your work üíù
